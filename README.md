# AI Customer Support Chatbot ü§ñ

This project is a simple, AI-powered chatbot prototype built to support user onboarding and automate responses to common questions.

It uses LangChain and Python to simulate how businesses can integrate conversational AI into their onboarding or support flows ‚Äî reducing repetitive queries, improving accessibility to key information, and saving time for both users and support teams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **LangChain** for prompt orchestration and chaining
- **Python** for core logic
- **PowerShell / Terminal** for local execution
- **VS Code** as the development environment

---

## üí° Why This Exists

Chatbots are widely used ‚Äî but this project shows how anyone can build a lightweight, adaptable version without needing a large team or infrastructure.

It's not about complexity. It's about:
